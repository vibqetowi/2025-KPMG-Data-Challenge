Team 7's submission to the KPMG case
Assumptions made:
Charge-out rate:
A charge-out rate is an indication of percentage completion of the project, however this is sometimes not valid, as some employees produce better quality output, hence a dollar billed is not always the same percentage increase in project development.

The amount of hours required to complete a phase is approximately equal to the BAC / the average charge-out rate of the people assigned to a phase.
Justification: We are estimating the amount of hours based on the Because BAC is =  to the sum of Î£ assignee(i) hours * rate (i), then the estimate above is a reasonable estimate. 
Impact: If we have the approximate work hours and the assumed start date of the project, we are able to derive the duration and end date of the project.

We are assuming project phases complete at a linear rate over time.
Impact: It allows us to calculate an estimate of the planned value of the project.

Estimated duration of the project
We make assumptions for the estimated duration of the project based on the average hourly rate of the employees involved and the BAC

Employees at the same level are interchangeable: we can 
Impact: We can assign them interchangeably based on project needs, with no efficiency loss.

The start of the project is assumed to be the date of the first billing of the phase.
Impact: It allows us to set the start date of the mandate, which was not provided. 

Planned value:
Assumption made: The project gets comple

Figures used for the proof of concept on excel:


AC (Actual costs):
= Sum of standard price + sum of admin fees

Planned value of the project:
= Days elapsed since the start of the project (assuming linear progress over time) 

Hours required to complete project:
= Average charge-out / BAC

Total estimated duration (days) of the project:
= Hours required to complete project / number of employees on the project / 24

Days Elapsed:
= Today-start date

Percentage schedule elapsed:
= Days elapsed / Total estimated duration in days

PV
= BAC * percentage Schedule elapsed

Estimated % completion (in hours)
=  Hours billed / total estimated average FTE hours to bill

EV
 = BAC * Estimated % completion (in hours)

CPI:
= EV / AC 

SPI: Scheduled performance index
= EV / PV

Example:

Budget at completion:
In this case, 2.3M is the budget for project with code ending 365, phase 000010


Calculations made:
We find the total number of employees active on each project and project phase
